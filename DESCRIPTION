Description: Functions for reordering
    input locations, finding ordered nearest neighbors
    (with help from 'FNN' package), grouping operations, 
    approximate likelihood evaluations, profile likelihoods,
    Gaussian process predictions, and conditional simulations.
    Covariance functions for spatial and spatial-temporal data
    on Euclidean domains and spheres are provided. The original 
    approximation is due to Vecchia (1988) 
    <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345768>, and the reordering and
    grouping methods are from Guinness (2018)
    <doi:10.1080/00401706.2018.1437476>.
